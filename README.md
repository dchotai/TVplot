# TVplot
Visualize IMDb episode ratings by season. Data pulled from the [Trakt.tv API](https://trakt.docs.apiary.io/) and [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/). Hosted on Heroku [here](https://tvplot.herokuapp.com/).

Heavily inspired by [Graph TV](http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/), which isn't under active development, so I decided to make it faster with Go.
